# 🎓 SIMA (Student Intelligent Model Assistant)

**Your Persian-language AI university guide** - Helping students navigate academic life with smart LLM assistance

## 🌟 Overview
SIMA solves key challenges for university students by providing instant answers about academic life, course selection, and campus information through advanced Persian-language AI capabilities.

**The dataset link and app demo will be here soon.**

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### Core Strategy
```python
1. Base Model → Llama3.2-1B (Persian optimized)
2. Fine-Tuning → GaLore technique
3. Enhancement → Multi-agent architecture
4. Learning → RL-powered knowledge improvement
```

### Key Components
    1. Persian-Language Specialization: Custom fine-tuning for academic context
    2. Prompt Engineering: Advanced template structures
    3. Adaptive Learning: Reinforcement learning for continuous improvement
    4. Agent System: Modular assistants for different university domains

### 📚 Dataset Development
    1. Design prompt templates
    2. Generate Q/A pairs using LLM augmentation  
    3. Perform EDA and preprocessing
    4. Combine prompts with Q/A data
    5. Token optimization

## 🚧 Future Roadmap
- Immediate Goals

      Complete dataset preparation (Q/A pairs + prompt templates)
      Hyperparameter optimization research
      GaLore fine-tuning implementation

- Advanced Development

      Multi-agent system integration
      RL-based continuous learning framework
      Persian knowledge distillation techniques
      Campus-specific module development
